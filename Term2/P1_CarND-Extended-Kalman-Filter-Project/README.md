# Extended Kalman Filter Project Submission
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Introduction
I have implement the project code and it is a struggle.  I am sincerely about the delay, since for the last 2 months I was working on my own paper, which is the requirement of my graduation with my degree.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Unzip the file,
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
4. Run it: `./ExtendedKF`
5. Start the simulator and watch magic happens.

* If you want to see the out put you can run step 4 as `./ExtendedKF >> out.txt`, which I provided from my last result. 

## Problem Facing
This project is very disoriented, the walk-through of the environment setup is badly written and over-simplified. I understand we need to have our "own" envronment set up, but you have to elaborate more about different scenarios. I was using Mac High Serie, no matter what I did, it didn't work at all. I woud apprecite you offer either an aws or more detailed instruction.

Also the simulator is super slow, I am using ubuntu, with quad cores, and I have to dedicate the machine run nothing but the simulator. If I open Chrome, the simulator will stuck. Please fix it for us, and I used the lowest setup.

## Results
I have the code changed and generate the results, and saved in `out.txt`. I double check the RMSEs, which are smaller than the ones from
the rubric.
