    "A color space is a specific organization of colors; color spaces provide a way to categorize colors and represent them in digital images.\n",
    "\n",
    "RGB is red-green-blue color space. You can think of this as a 3D space, in this case a cube, where any color can be represented by a 3D coordinate of R, G, and B values. For example, white has the coordinate (255, 255, 255), which has the maximum value for red, green, and blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you read in an image using matplotlib.image.imread() you will get an RGB image, but if you read it in using OpenCV cv2.imread() this will give you a BGR image.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other ways to represent the colors in an image besides just composed of red, green, and blue values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HSV & HLS\n",
    "There is also *HSV* color space (hue, saturation, and value), and HLS space (hue, lightness, and saturation). These are some of the most commonly used color spaces in image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get some intuition about these color spaces, you can generally think of Hue as the value that represents color independent of any change in brightness. So if you imagine a basic red paint color, then add some white to it or some black to make that color lighter or darker -- the underlying color remains the same and the hue for all of these colors will be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Lightness and Value represent different ways to measure the relative lightness or darkness of a color. For example, a dark red will have a similar hue but much lower value for lightness than a light red. Saturation also plays a part in this; saturation is a measurement of colorfulness. So, as colors get lighter and closer to white, they have a lower saturation value, whereas colors that are the most intense, like a bright primary color (imagine a bright red, blue, or yellow), have a high saturation value. You can get a better idea of these values by looking at the 3D color spaces pictured below.\n",

    "Most of these different color spaces were either inspired by the human vision system, and/or developed for efficient use in television screen displays and computer graphics.

    "\n",
    "In the project at the end of this module, the first thing you'll do is to compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients. You only need to compute these once, and then you'll apply them to undistort each new frame. Next, you'll apply thresholds to create a binary image and then apply a perspective transform.\n",
    "\n",

    "You'll want to try out various combinations of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image where the lane lines are clearly visible.

    "### Perspective Transform\n",
    "Next, you want to identify four source points for your perspective transform. In this case, you can assume the road is a flat plane. This isn't strictly true, but it can serve as an approximation for this project. You would like to pick four points in a trapezoidal shape (similar to region masking) that would represent a rectangle when looking down on the road from above.\n",

    "### Line Finding Method: Peaks in a Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "After applying calibration, thresholding, and a perspective transform to a road image, you should have a binary image where the lane lines stand out clearly. However, you still need to decide explicitly which pixels are part of the lines and which belong to the left line and which belong to the right line.\n",

    "### Sliding Window\n",
    "With this histogram I am adding up the pixel values along each column in the image. In my thresholded binary image, pixels are either 0 or 1, so the two most prominent peaks in this histogram will be good indicators of the x-position of the base of the lane lines. I can use that as a starting point for where to search for the lines. From that point, I can use a sliding window, placed around the line centers, to find and follow the lines up to the top of the frame.\n",

    "\n",
    "The y values of your image increase from top to bottom, so if, for example, you wanted to measure the radius of curvature closest to your vehicle, you could evaluate the formula above at the y value corresponding to the bottom of your image, or in Python, at yvalue = image.shape[0].\n",

    "\n",
    "This involves measuring how long and wide the section of lane is that we're projecting in our warped image. We could do this in detail by measuring out the physical lane in the field of view of the camera, but for this project, you can assume that if you're projecting a section of lane similar to the images above, the lane is about 30 meters long and 3.7 meters wide. Or, if you prefer to derive a conversion from pixel space to world space in your own images, compare your images with U.S. regulations that require a minimum lane width of 12 feet or 3.7 meters, and the dashed lane lines are 10 feet or 3 meters long each.\n",

    "## Tips and Tricks for the Project\n",
    "In this lesson, you've acquired some new tools to help you find and track the lane lines. By all means, you are welcome and encouraged to use the techniques you used in the very first project. Here are some tips for the upcoming project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Camera Calibration\n",
    "The calibration images in the lesson exercise were taken with a different camera setting and a different chessboard pattern than the calibration images for the project. You need to set your chessboard size to 9x6 for the project instead of 8x6 as in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do your curvature values make sense?\n",
    "We're not expecting anything like perfection for this project, but a good check on whether or not your perspective transform worked as expected, your conversion from pixel space to world space was correct, and that you successfully calculated the radius of curvature is whether or not your results are roughly consistent with reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an image from Google maps of where the project video was made (just northwest of the Udacity office!). Here, I've drawn a circle to coincide with the first left curve in the project video. This is a very rough estimate, but as you can see, the radius of that circle is approximately 1 km. You don't need to tune your algorithm to report exactly a radius of 1 km in the project, but if you're reporting 10 km or 0.1 km, you know there might be something wrong with your calculations!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Offset\n",
    "You can assume the camera is mounted at the center of the car, such that the lane center is the midpoint at the bottom of the image between the two lines you've detected. The offset of the lane center from the center of the image (converted from pixels to meters) is your distance from the center of the lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tracking\n",
    "After you've tuned your pipeline on test images, you'll run on a video stream, just like in the first project. In this case, however, you're going to keep track of things like where your last several detections of the lane lines were and what the curvature was, so you can properly treat new detections. To do this, it's useful to define a Line() class to keep track of all the interesting parameters you measure from frame to frame. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Define a class to receive the characteristics of each line detection\n",
    "class Line():\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        # was the line detected in the last iteration?\n",
    "        self.detected = False  \n",
    "        # x values of the last n fits of the line\n",
    "        self.recent_xfitted = [] \n",
    "        #average x values of the fitted line over the last n iterations\n",
    "        self.bestx = None     \n",
    "        #polynomial coefficients averaged over the last n iterations\n",
    "        self.best_fit = None  \n",
    "        #polynomial coefficients for the most recent fit\n",
    "        self.current_fit = [np.array([False])]  \n",
    "        #radius of curvature of the line in some units\n",
    "        self.radius_of_curvature = None \n",
    "        #distance in meters of vehicle center from the line\n",
    "        self.line_base_pos = None \n",
    "        #difference in fit coefficients between last and new fits\n",
    "        self.diffs = np.array([0,0,0], dtype='float') \n",
    "        #x values for detected line pixels\n",
    "        self.allx = None  \n",
    "        #y values for detected line pixels\n",
    "        self.ally = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an instance of the Line() class for the left and right lane lines to keep track of recent detections and to perform sanity checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sanity Check\n",
    "Ok, so your algorithm found some lines. Before moving on, you should check that the detection makes sense. To confirm that your detected lane lines are real, you might consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Checking that they have similar curvature\n",
    "* Checking that they are separated by approximately the right distance horizontally\n",
    "* Checking that they are roughly parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "### Look-Ahead Filter\n",
    "Once you've found the lane lines in one frame of video, and you are reasonably confident they are actually the lines you are looking for, you don't need to search blindly in the next frame. You can simply search within a window around the previous detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you fit a polynomial, then for each y position, you have an x position that represents the lane center from the last frame. Search for the new line within +/- some margin around the old line center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Double check the bottom of the page here to remind yourself how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then check that your new line detections makes sense (i.e. expected curvature, separation, and slope).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reset\n",
    "If your sanity checks reveal that the lane lines you've detected are problematic for some reason, you can simply assume it was a bad or difficult frame of video, retain the previous positions from the frame prior and step to the next frame to search again. If you lose the lines for several frames in a row, you should probably start searching from scratch using a histogram and sliding window, or another method, to re-establish your measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smoothing\n",
    "Even when everything is working, your line detections will jump around from frame to frame a bit and it can be preferable to smooth over the last n frames of video to obtain a cleaner result. Each time you get a new high-confidence measurement, you can append it to the list of recent measurements and then take an average over n past measurements to obtain the lane position you want to draw onto the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawing\n",
    "Once you have a good measurement of the line positions in warped space, it's time to project your measurement back down onto the road! Let's suppose, as in the previous example, you have a warped binary image called warped, and you have fit the lines with a polynomial and have arrays called ploty, left_fitx and right_fitx, which represent the x and y pixel values of the lines. You can then project those lines onto the original image as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Create an image to draw the lines on\n",
    "warp_zero = np.zeros_like(warped).astype(np.uint8)\n",
    "color_warp = np.dstack((warp_zero, warp_zero, warp_zero))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recast the x and y points into usable format for cv2.fillPoly()\n",
    "pts_left = np.array([np.transpose(np.vstack([left_fitx, ploty]))])\n",
    "pts_right = np.array([np.flipud(np.transpose(np.vstack([right_fitx, ploty])))])\n",
    "pts = np.hstack((pts_left, pts_right))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Draw the lane onto the warped blank image\n",
    "cv2.fillPoly(color_warp, np.int_([pts]), (0,255, 0))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Warp the blank back to original image space using inverse perspective matrix (Minv)\n",
    "newwarp = cv2.warpPerspective(color_warp, Minv, (image.shape[1], image.shape[0])) \n",
    "# Combine the result with the original image\n",
    "result = cv2.addWeighted(undist, 1, newwarp, 0.3, 0)\n",
    "plt.imshow(result)\n",
